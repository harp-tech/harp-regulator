# Harp Regulator

> **Regulator** (musical)
>
> Noun. A person who maintains and tunes ("regulates") a harp.

âš  This tool is in alpha and relies on Harp specifications which have not been ratified. It will work for [Pico-based Harp devices](https://github.com/harp-tech/core.pico) in manual update mode, but most functionality requires special non-conforming firmware. See [Harp Toolkit](https://github.com/harp-tech/harp-cli) for the existing firmware update tool.

See the docs folder for micro-specifications that may need to be ratified as part of the Harp spec before this tool can be productized.
